# Running the CCA integration

```{r}
cca <- IntegrateLayers(
  object = merged, 
  method = CCAIntegration,
  orig.reduction = "pca", 
  new.reduction = "integrated.cca",
  verbose = FALSE)
```

# Now the integrated object needs to be processed via running PCA, UMAP, FindNeighbors() and FindClusters(). 

```{r}
cca <- cca%>%
  RunPCA(verbose = FALSE)%>%
  RunUMAP(reduction = "integrated.cca", dims = 1:30)%>%
  FindNeighbors(dims = 1:30, reduction = "integrated.cca")%>%
  FindClusters(resolution = 0.1)
```

# Visualize the results. 

```{r}
DimPlot(cca, 
        group.by = "seurat_clusters",
        label = T,
        repel = T,
        label.box = T) +
  NoLegend() 

# We can also group the DimPlot based on the sample. 

DimPlot(cca, 
        group.by = "orig.ident")
```
